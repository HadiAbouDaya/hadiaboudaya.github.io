  "Born and raised in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon, I grew up fascinated by physics, mathematics, and how things work. After earning my Lebanese Baccalaureate in General Science from Collège Saint Joseph - Zahle, I moved to Beirut to study Software Engineering at USJ-ESIB.",
  "During my engineering degree, I discovered machine learning and never looked back. Starting with computer vision projects — vine detection from satellite imagery, sentiment analysis with BERT — I quickly transitioned to deploying real-time inference on NVIDIA Jetson devices at Decentra Tech, achieving 60 FPS on edge hardware.",
  "At Mobile Arts, I scaled ML to production on AWS: content moderation services with 96% recall, anomaly detection pipelines on Lambda, and predictive engines on SageMaker that boosted ad revenue by 30%. This experience cemented my passion for building ML systems that deliver real business value.",
  "The emergence of large language models shifted my focus toward multi-agent systems. At MOPO, I co-architected a multi-LLM orchestration platform with RAG pipelines and knowledge graphs, contributing to a $5M seed raise. As a freelance consultant, I built RAG chatbots, sales copilots, and voice-to-JSON agents for startups across Paris, Beirut, and San Francisco.",
  "In parallel, I pursued a Master's in Data Science & AI Strategy at emlyon business school, with an exchange semester at McGill University in Montreal. My end-of-studies internship at Savencia applied causal inference to optimize industrial manufacturing processes.",
  "Today, I consult on AI-powered SaaS products at Supportful, building multi-agent systems with LangGraph for B2B sales intelligence and sports facility management. In July 2026, I join AWS EMEA as an Associate Delivery Consultant for AI/ML — helping enterprises design and deploy production-grade GenAI solutions at scale.",
